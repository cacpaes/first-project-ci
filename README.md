<p>This page aims to provide people seeking cognitive behavioral therapy with a quality service.

The central idea is to show people interested in individual therapy how this approach works, for whom it is effective and to provide a point of contact for more specific questions, in addition to offering online psychotherapy service through the Contact Us field.

The website also contains important information about the psychologist responsible for the service, including her training and previous experience.
